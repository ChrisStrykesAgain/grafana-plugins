## Configuring plugins directory
Before you can get started building plugins, you need to set up your environment for plugin development.

To discover plugins, Grafana scans a plugin directory, the location of which depends on your operating system.

1. Clone this repo to your local machine using https://github.com/ni-kismet/grafana-plugins.

2. Find the plugins property in the Grafana configuration file and set the plugins property to the path of the grafana-plugins directory. Refer to the [Grafana configuration documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/configuration/#plugins) for more information.
```
[paths]
plugins = "/path/to/grafana-plugins"
```
3. Restart Grafana if itâ€™s already running, to load the new configuration.
